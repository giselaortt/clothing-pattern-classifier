### Results:

### Implemented:
  - Pre-processing. Basically get all the images and convert it to a data frame
  - First model using MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)

### To be implemented:
  - Confusion matrix
  - More models
  - Cross validation
  - function to measure acuracia
  - use numbers instead of strings for the classes to implove efficiency
