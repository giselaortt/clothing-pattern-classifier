# Image Classifier for clothing patterns

### Data:
the data was forked from here https://github.com/lstearns86/clothing-pattern-dataset

### Results:

### Implemented:
  - Pre-processing. Basically get all the images and convert it to a data frame
  - First model using MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)
  - Function to measure accuracy
  - Confusion matrix
  - Use numbers instead of strings for the classes to implove efficiency

### To be implemented:
  - Use a model with deeplearning
  - Cross validation

### Tecnologies:
- Opencv
- Sklearn
- numpy
- pandas
